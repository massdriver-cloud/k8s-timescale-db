# Operator Guide for k8s-timescale-db

Built on PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB is an open-source time-series SQL database. It is purpose-built for fast ingest and complex queries across large amounts of time-series data.

## Use Cases

- Monitor rate of flow of vehicles at an intersection, telemetry from an aircraft during flight. [NYC Taxi Cabs](https://docs.timescale.com/timescaledb/latest/tutorials/nyc-taxi-cab/)
- Metrics from a fitness app. [Elixir Health Tracker](https://github.com/bitfo/timescale/blob/main/guides/intro.livemd)
- Any time-series dataset.

## Configuration Presets

### Development

For development we use a small disk and set the CPU and Memory limits to low values.

### Production

For our production preset, we use a large disk and increase the CPU and Memory by a lot to handle production workloads.

## Design

This deploys TimescaleDB as a single node. The Helm chart for Timescale Multinode is no longer being maintained and there is a [call for maintainers](https://github.com/timescale/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/timescaledb-multinode#call-for-maintainers). However, a single node is still highly performant and production-ready.

## Trade-Offs

- We disabled SSL because this bundle is intended to be used inside a private network.
- If you decomission the bundle and deploy it again, the password in the new artifact won't work. This is because `helm` uninstall leaves PVCs behind, so we need to delete them manually otherwise subsequent runs will use the original password. This can make debugging quite difficult... Deleting the bundle from the canvas and dragging a new one on will result in a new unique suffix and the password in the produced artifact will work.
